### Collection of my dockers

#### Reversing
This will contain various edits and tweaks so that I can have a sane reversing env on any machine with docker.

Current tools:
gdb
radare2

**TODO**:
Add a non-root user and properly configure a working dir so that the user cannot modify shared volumes

Maybe valabind bindings for radare to automate it with python

qemu so it can emulate different architectures
